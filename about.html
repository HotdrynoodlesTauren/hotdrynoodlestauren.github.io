        <h2>Hi thereüëã, I am Yi!</h2>
        <p>
          Thanks for stopping by my website. Here is my story if you'd like to
          know:
        </p>
        <p>
          My interest in computer science originated from my architecture
          background. In my 2nd year in college, I learned a novel approach in
          architecture called <strong>parametric design</strong> that utilizes
          an algorithmic thinking process that uses variables to manipulate
          equations to create geometries for building design. I immediately fell
          in love with this more mathematical approach that was so refreshing
          compared to the traditional designs that led to dull box-shaped
          buildings. Later I self-taught ‚ÄúGrasshopper‚Äù, a visual programming
          language and environment developed for architectural design.
        </p>
        <p>
          The desire and longing for avant-garde thoughts and new design
          technologies led me to pursue a master's degree at
          <strong>Southern California Institute of Architecture</strong>, a
          world-renowned independent architecture school. There, I learned
          ‚ÄúPython for Grasshopper‚Äù and ‚ÄúProcessing‚Äù, a java based Integrated
          Development Environment built for visual arts. Although these tools
          are challenging for an architecture student, I feel deeply satisfied
          and accomplished to execute exceptional design ambitions with their
          help. The more programming I learned the more I realized that I found
          my new calling.
        </p>
        <p>
          After graduation, I have worked for more than 3 years in the
          architecture industry. Meanwhile, I have witnessed that the ongoing
          information revolution has realized new business models and design
          ideas that were hard to implement in the past.
          <strong>Victor Hugo</strong> once famously argued that it was the
          invention of the printing press that destroyed the edifice of the
          gothic cathedral. Similarly, I think new technology will force
          traditional industries to adopt themselves to the trends of a new era.
          I believe a transition into the tech industry can also help me carry
          out more inspiring ideas in the future. That's how I decided to persue
          another master's degree in <strong>Computer Science</strong> at
          <strong>Northeastern University</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I always have passions in sociology, technology and design, it's
          natural for me to took the initiative to study human behaviors and
          learn interaction design and earned a certificate in
          <strong>Human-Computer Interaction</strong>. I have many design
          concepts for mobile apps where I interviewed different potential
          users, created prototypes and conducted user experience testing with
          my friends. I have also asked for feedback from my designer friends.As
          a designer, I hope to solve people's problem via design and make their
          lives smoother.
